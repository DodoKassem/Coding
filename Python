//arithmetic operations

print(10 * 3)
print(10 / 3)
print(10 // 3)      //output the number without decimals    
print(10 % 3)       //output the remainder of the division
print(10 ** 3)      

//augmented assignment operators ---> write the same code in a shorter form

x += (number)
x /= (number)
x //= (number)
x %= (number)
x *= (number)


//operator procedence (order of operators)

x = 10 + 3 * 2

Order of operators:-

0-parenthesis (brackets)
1- Exponentiation ---> 2 ** 3
2- Multiplication or division
3- Addition or subtraction

x = 10 + 3 * 2 ** 2
print(x)              //outpute is 22


//math functions

x = 2.9
print(round(x))      //output is 3

x = 2.9
print(abs(-2.9))     //output is 2.9 (always output the opposite)

import math
print(math.ceil(2.9))     //output is 3

import math
print(math.floor(2.9))     //output is 2

Note: search for python module to learn about different functions
